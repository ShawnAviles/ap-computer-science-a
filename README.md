AP Computer Science A - Highschool Course

This is the final repo (3 out of 3) that is used to save my old highschool Java class exercises. 
AP Computer Science A was the first class that genuinly taught me the core concepts of computer science
that actually stuck with me. I took this class during my Senior year (2020-2021).
